# Clueless Team
The project idea that we have come up with is an application that will allow teachers to share their lesson plans. We will ask the user to select what state they are in, and also what grade(s) they teach to be able to give them resources more specific to them easier, but will still make the entire collection available to them. We will hopefully have a few templates already but will have teachers create more and the collection will grow as the user interaction grows.

## Prerequisites
The project mainly follow MERN stack development project. the following stuffs need to be installed to run the project. 

### `npm module`
### `Express`
### `Mongoose`
### `React`
### `React Bootstrap`
### `react router`
### `react dom`
### `nodemon`
### `axios`
### `cors`

## Run Instructions


## Available Scripts

In the frontend project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## To run the backend
Go the backend folder and run 

### `npm start`

Server running on port 5000
MongoDB connected

## Website navigation

The Homepage page will be open. From the Home page we can go to sign in or public and private templates page by clicking.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
