# Introduction
The project idea that we have come up with is a website titled EduBridge. This will allow teachers to share lesson plans and templates for assignments they may encouter throughout there career. We previously were creating this project as a mobile app however due to multiple problems that occured during the development (which are described in more detail below) we believed it was best to changed to making a website platform.We will hopefully have a few templates already but will have teachers create more and the collection will grow as the user interaction grows.
We hope to get some input from current teachers in things they would be interested in seeing. As well as some current students that are going to be going into teaching so that it can benefit teachers no matter where they are in their careers.



**Possible Feature Descriptions**


* Public and private templates pages - Some templates teachers may want to keep private or they may be obligated to keep it pribe, so this option is important if a user would run into that sort of situation

* Seeing specific for subjects/grades - This would act as a filter for teachers of specific subjects to be able to find worksheets or projects along the lines of what they teach, or post their templates with these subjects in mind

* Template Submissions - This feature would be a page will teachers can upload tempalates, which would then go through a manual process to determine if the template is of quality to be added to the page. We hope this way will keep from inappropriate items entering the website and less potential clutter of low quality templates.  

* NOTE: As of right now these are are first draft ideas for this features and time will tell whether some or possible or their descriptions may change 


# Anticipated Technologies
We will need our laptops, possibly go and use a PC to be able to handle all of the application if one of our laptops doesn't have enough processing power. We will using visual studio code, along with react, and node.js to be able to develop out application. This way we can JavaScript and HTML to be able to make the website. If we get far enough, we can then use github to host the website itself.  


# Method/Approach
We are planning on splitting the work on some working on the backend side of the project and the others working on the front end and then we will come together to get them to all work together. We have a plan for how the website is going to look and work, which is what will allow us to split the work this way, also this way when we bring both ends together it will just be editing some code instead of having to start all new code. We plan to use our mobile app mockups, as the base for how the features, the pages on the website will look, but include changes that fit the new format best.

# Estimated Timeline
Due to the length of time left for the project at the time we decided to change from a mobile app to a website, we have decided to split apart pages and featuers, and work on them individually, and come together with the pages, we get done. We plan to focus primarily on our public template page, as we believe it is the most important part of our website. Depending on the time length that these may get completed will will add features, we previously identified in our mobile application idea slowly to make sure we have a proper work flow.  

# Anticipated Problems
We have recently ran into a problem with our lead developer who had a finger injury. Along with this the Android Studio application proved to not be the best application to develop a website for teachers, as teachers are more likely to use their computers for work instead of phone apps. To solve this, we made the executive decsion to change from a mobile app to a website. However due to the duration of time left for the project this could lead to not all the features being implemented, but we will work to include as much as we can possible have. 

Remember this is a living document is expected to be changed as you make progress on your project.
