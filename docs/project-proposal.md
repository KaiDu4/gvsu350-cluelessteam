# Introduction
The project idea that we have come up with is an application that will allow teachers to share their lesson plans. We will ask the user to select what state they are in, and also what grade(s) they teach to be able to give them resources more specific to them easier, but will still make the entire collection available to them. We will hopefully have a few templates already but will have teachers create more and the collection will grow as the user interaction grows.
We hope to get some input from current teachers in things they would be interested in seeing. As well as some current students that are going to be going into teaching so that it can benefit teachers no matter where they are in their careers.



**Possible Feature Descriptions**

* Direct messaging - A sort of simple messaging system to be able to send templates of message plans, or just regular messages with other users/teachers

* Creating and editing templates - We want to be able to use google docs or works, as well as other options for teachers to make their own templates of worksheets, or tools. Along with the ablility to let other teachers use those templates and edit them for their own usage.

* Making public and private templates - Some templates teachers may want to keep private or they may be obligated to keep it pribe, so this option is important if a user would run into that sort of situation

* Seeing specific for subjects/grades - This would act as a filter for teachers of specific subjects to be able to find worksheets or projects along the lines of what they teach, or post their templates with these subjects in mind

* NOTE: As of right now these are are first draft ideas for this features and time will tell whether some or possible or their descriptions may change 


# Anticipated Technologies
We will need our laptops, possibly go and use a PC to be able to handle all of the application if one of our laptops doesn't have enough processing power. We will install a Java IDE, as of right now it is AndriodStudio to be able to help get some of the framework of the code, so we can make the coding more about actually getting the features and less about just trying to set up the whole framework of Java.

# Method/Approach
We are planning on splitting the work on some working on the backend side of the project and the others working on the front end and then we will come together to get themm to all work together. We have a plan for how the app is going to look and work, which is what will allow us to split the work this way, also this way when we bring both ends together it will just be editing some code instead of having to start all new code.

# Estimated Timeline
We'll start by focusing on the back end so we can support the front end before we start fully working on the front end. I estimate this will take about a week. From there the front end will start to be able to get programmed which, we will want to have the general outline even if it doesn't do anything or fully work after about a week. I feel that each step that we want to complete can be broken up into week long things and it will make the work easier to manage than setting big things to hit after 4 weeks. I guess having the full back end "done" minus finding bugs could take about a month to a month and a half. Then getting the front end to look how we want can take about 2 months and will line up with finishing the back end.

# Anticipated Problems
We are planning on using Java for most of our coding for the app, the problems we may have with this is that none of us have a whole lot of expeerience with programming in Java so we will be struggling a bit with that but besides that it does not seem as though we should run into too many issues.

Remember this is a living document is expected to be changed as you make progress on your project.
